# RA2CE

Risk Assessment and Adaptation for Critical InfrastructurE (RA2CE) is a tool developed by Deltares for calculating damages and losses for infrastructure networks resulting from hazards.

The tool consists currently of four components:
- Network creation
- Exposure
- Criticality
- Damages

(-Prioritization to be implemented)

## Network Creation
THe user needs to decide which type of input data will be used to create the infrastructure network. Currently the following 3 methods are implemented
- Create a network based on OSM dump file (.osm.pbf)
- Create a network based on OSM online download
- Create a network based on a shapefile

## Exposure

## Criticality
This module calculated the redundancy based criticality. There are three possible analysis

When infrastructure usage data are available it is also possible to calculate the losses.

## Damages


## Risk prioritization

# Pre-processing

# User input
THe user needs to fill out the document to_fill_in.xlsx and has to choose between the following options
