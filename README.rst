RA2CE
=====

Risk Assessment and Adaptation for Critical InfrastructurE (RA2CE) is a
tool developed by Deltares for calculating damages and losses for
infrastructure networks resulting from hazards.

The tool consists currently of four components:

- Network creation
- Exposure
- Criticality
- Damages

- Prioritization - to be implemented
- Adaptation - to be implemented

The user needs to decide which analysis should be performed:

- Direct damages
- Redundancy-based criticality
- Both

Both Direct damanges and Redundancy-based criticality have their own
functionalities. See for more detail below.
