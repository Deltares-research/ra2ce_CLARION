# Traffic analysis.

In this module all dataclasses, classes and related can be found in order to generate a traffic analysis.
We distinguish two types of analysis:
- Traffic analysis (`TrafficAnalysis`). Provides regular and egalitarian traffic data.
- Equity analysis (`EquityAnalysis`), contains equity data relating regions and their road 'weights'. Provides regular, egalitarian and prioritarian traffic data.

Both analysis are specializations of the base class `TrafficAnalysisBase`.
