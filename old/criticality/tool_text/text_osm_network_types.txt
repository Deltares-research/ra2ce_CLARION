You can also specify several different network types:
	- Drive: get drivable public streets (but not service roads)
	- Drive_service: get drivable streets, including service roads
	- Walk: get all streets and paths that pedestrians can use (this network type ignores one-way directionality)
	- Bike: get all streets and paths that cyclists can use
	- All: download all non-private OSM streets and paths
	- All_private: download all OSM streets and paths, including private-access ones
