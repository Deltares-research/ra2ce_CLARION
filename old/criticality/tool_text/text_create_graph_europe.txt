This functionality relies on data from OSM that is on the N-drive, these paths are
already filled in the Excel. You need a shapefile covering the area that should be
analysed. Fill in the name of that shapefile in the excel that will open later.

This data is linked with flood data in Europe, therefore this specific analysis can
only be done for Europe. Also, the NUTS-3 regions that should be analysed can be
selected. These can be viewed via the shapefile that is listed in the Excel that
will open.
